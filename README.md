## 📥 **Download**
👉 [**Download the latest release here**](https://github.com/alirezafahimi98/Damage-State-Predictor-Tool/releases)

The executable is packaged as a **single .exe file** using **PyInstaller**.

---

## ✅ **Features**
- Predicts damage states for structural, nonstructural drift-sensitive, and nonstructural acceleration-sensitive components
- Predicts seismic loss (as repair cost to replacement cost ratio) and structural repair time 
- Easy-to-use GUI
- Includes pre-trained ML models for fast predictions

## ⚙️ **System Requirements**
- **OS:** Windows
- **Disk Space:** ~300 MB free
- **No Python installation required**

---

## ▶️ **How to Run**
1. Download `Damage State Predictor.exe` from the [Releases page](https://github.com/alirezafahimi98/Damage-State-Predictor-Tool/releases).
2. Place the file in any folder and **double-click to run**.
3. No installation needed. The app is fully standalone.

## ⚠️ **Notes**
- This EXE was generated from **trusted Python code** using **PyInstaller**.
- The file is safe.
- The data related to the external verification of the final predictive model used in the paper can be also be found in this GitHub repository (https://github.com/alirezafahimi98/Damage-State-Predictor-Tool).
