The executable is packaged as a **single .exe file** using **PyInstaller**.

---

## ✅ **Features**
- Predicts damage states for structural, nonstructural drift-sensitive, and nonstructural acceleration-sensitive components
- Predicts seismic loss (as repair cost to replacement cost ratio) and structural repair time 
- Easy-to-use GUI
- Includes pre-trained ML models for fast predictions

## ⚙️ **System Requirements**
- **OS:** Windows
- **Disk Space:** ~300 MB free
- **No Python installation required**

---

## ▶️ **How to Run**
1. Download `Damage State Predictor.exe` from the [Releases page](https://github.com/alirezafahimi98/Damage-State-Predictor-Tool/releases).
2. Place the file in any folder and **double-click to run**.
3. No installation needed. The app is fully standalone.
